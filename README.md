# CS300-portfolio
Portfolio Submission for CS 300 - Sulakshana Mehta
1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was assigned a project in which I needed to design a course planning system that loaded information about the courses it represented and displayed them in both sorted order by name or offerings followed by time on each. I judged how well various data structures such as vectors, hash tables and binary search trees performed in both runtime and memory use.
2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I made implementations of every structure, each one with its own way of loading courses from both main memory and disk to a sorted form for later retrieval. The knowledge I had about data structures helped me choose which one would be most efficient for each taskâ€”then it was a simple matter of seeing how they performed in terms of watched times or system CPU load.
3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I had to truncate issues such as file parsing sophistication and validate input types manually. I also had to review sort logic and traversal methods for every kind of structure and test edge conditions.
4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It has made me focus more on choosing good structures and making the trade-offs between them. I found that having plenty of forethought at the beginning saves a lot of later re-invention.
5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Now I break things down into more modular functions and think both about scaling and the demanding challenges of the real world as well as efficiency.
